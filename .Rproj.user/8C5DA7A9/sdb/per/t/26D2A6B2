Due to some beautiful and effective features,\nthe constructed in-tree proves well-suited for data clustering. Although\nthere exist some undesired edges (i.e., the inter-cluster edges) in this in-tree,\nthose edges are usually very distinguishable, in sharp contrast to the cases\nin the famous Minimal Spanning Tree (MST). Here, we propose another\ngraph-theoretical method, called the Hierarchical Nearest Neighbor Descent\n(HNND). Like ND, HNND also organizes a dataset into an in-tree, but in\na more efficient way. Consequently, HNND-based clustering (HNND-C) is\nmore efficient than ND-based clustering (ND-C) as well. This is well proved\nby the experimental results on five high-dimensional and large-size mass cytometry\ndatasets. The experimental results also show that HNND-C achieves\noverall better performance than some state-of-the-art clustering methods.\n",
